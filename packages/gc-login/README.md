# gc-login

The single sign-on component is a drop-in solution to provide SSO for
any GCTools, or GoC site.  This component provides a complete "client-side
only" authentication solution using `oidc-client`, and can also be
customized to defer authentication to a backend server, or to orchestrate
remote authentication using the `RAP` protocol using a hybrid client+server
design.
